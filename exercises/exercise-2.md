    Exercise 2 - Use your Signal

    Create a HTML element that represents your Signal's value.
    Try to make it update as your Signal updates. You could use a `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()` to have your Signal update its value over time.

    The most basic example and exercise here would be to write a counter example either using buttons or incrementing every second.
