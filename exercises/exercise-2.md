## Exercise 2 - Use your Signal!

*Re-use your previous Stackblitz link, or create a new fork if you like. Make sure to write the URL down somewhere :).*

Try to use and consume your Signal.
- Can you set a value? 
- Can you change the value over time? 
  - On user action? 
- Can you make a counter? 
- Can you reflect the changes in the HTML when the Signal changes?
