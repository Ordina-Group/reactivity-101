## Exercise 2 - Use your Signal!

_Re-use your previous Stackblitz link, or create a new fork if you like. Make sure to write the URL down somewhere :)._

Try to use and consume your Signal.

- Can you set a value?
- Can you change the value over time? (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`)
  - On user action? `<button> ?`
- Can you make a counter?
- Can you reflect the changes in the HTML when the Signal changes?
  - Hint: use `document.getELementById('...').innerHTML = 'new content'` to update the content on a page.

The most basic example and exercise here would be to write a counter example either using buttons or incrementing every second.
